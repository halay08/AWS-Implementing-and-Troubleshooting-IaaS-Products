Move your infrastructure to the cloud. Learn the primary IaaS components of Amazon Web Services so that you can procure, configure, and deploy the right services for your organization. Instructor Brian Eiler explains the functions of each major product while diving into the aspects of implementation and troubleshooting. He covers Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), and storage, including S3 and Elastic Block Store (EBS). By the end of the course, you'll have a thorough understanding of AWS IaaS options and be prepared to answer questions from the AWS Certified Solutions Architect (Associate) exam.

**Topics include**:
- AWS global infrastructure
- VPC use cases
- EC2 instance types
- EC2 purchasing and troubleshooting
- Creating AMIs
- Using AWS storage solutions such as EBS, EFS, S3, and Glacier
- Versioning and cross-region replication on S3
